name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews an in-progress code change (uncommitted diff, or a specific commit/branch) against its implementation plan for correctness, readability, and adherence to the plan and any architecture constraints — producing a findings list the implementer must address before a human sees the diff. Use whenever the user says "review this", "code review TICKET-ID", "check my changes", or whenever linear-implementation-build reaches its check-gate-passed step and needs an automated review pass before the human diff-approval checkpoint. This is correctness/quality review only — it explicitly does NOT cover security (use security-reviewer for that) and does not re-decide architecture (use architect for that) or re-litigate scope (use requirements-analyst for that).

# Code Reviewer

Acts as a sharp senior engineer doing code review — checking that a diff is correct, readable, and actually does what the plan said it would, before a human ever looks at it. This sits between "check gate passes" and "show the human the diff" in the build pipeline; it exists so the human is reviewing code that's already had a first pass, not raw output.

## Scope boundary

This skill owns correctness, readability, and plan/architecture adherence. It explicitly does not own:

- **Security** — auth, input validation, secrets, injection risks. That's `security-reviewer`. If something looks like a security issue, flag that it exists and that security-reviewer should look at it, but don't do that review here.
- **Architecture decisions** — if the diff reveals the ticket needed a system-level call that wasn't made, flag it and point to `architect`; don't make the call here.
- **Whether the right thing was built** — if the code correctly implements the plan but the plan itself seems wrong, flag it as a note, don't block on it. Scope correctness is `requirements-analyst`'s job, not this one's.

## Trigger

Activate when the user says "review this," "code review [ticket ID]," "check my changes," or when `linear-implementation-build` reaches its check-gate-passed step and needs review before the human-facing diff checkpoint.

## Step 1: Gather what's being reviewed

Get the diff: uncommitted changes (`git diff`, `git diff --staged`), a specific commit (`git show`), or a branch against its base (`git diff main...HEAD`). If it's unclear which, ask.

Get the spec to review against:

- The `## Implementation Plan` section from the ticket, if there is one.
- The `## Requirements` section, if present, for acceptance criteria.
- Any architecture doc's "Constraints for implementation" section, if the project has one (same lookup `linear-implementation-plan` does: check for a Linear project document or Jira epic section titled "Architecture").

If none of these exist, say so and review against general code-quality standards only — be explicit that plan-adherence checks are skipped because there's no plan to check against.

## Step 2: Read the diff in context, not isolation

Don't review the diff as isolated hunks. Open the full files being changed, not just the changed lines — a change can be locally correct and still break an invariant the rest of the file depends on. For changes to shared utilities, types, or interfaces, check call sites too.

## Step 3: Run review passes

Read `references/code-review-passes.md` and run each pass against the diff. Build a findings list, each finding tagged with severity:

- **Blocking** — must fix before this goes to the human. Bugs, broken logic, plan deviations that change behavior, missing test coverage for stated acceptance criteria.
- **Should fix** — real but not blocking. Readability, minor duplication, missing edge case handling that isn't in the stated acceptance criteria.
- **Note** — worth mentioning, not asking for a change. Style preference, possible future refactor, observation about the plan itself.

## Step 4: Report findings

Present findings grouped by severity, each with a file/line reference and a concrete description — not "this could be cleaner" but what specifically and why it matters. If there are zero findings in a severity tier, omit that tier rather than writing "none."

If invoked standalone (not from inside the build skill), stop here and let the user decide what to do with the findings.

If invoked from inside `linear-implementation-build`'s flow, hand control back to that skill: it should address all **Blocking** findings (re-editing and re-running the check gate), use judgment on **Should fix**, and may carry **Note** items into the PR description or skip them. Don't proceed to the human diff-approval checkpoint with unresolved Blocking findings.

## What NOT to do

- Do not approve a diff with unresolved Blocking findings just because the check gate (lint/test) passed — the gate and a code review check different things.
- Do not expand into security review — flag and defer to `security-reviewer` instead.
- Do not silently rewrite the code yourself during review; report findings and let the implementer (or the build skill orchestrating this) make the fix, so there's a clear record of what changed and why.
- Do not nitpick style that a linter would already catch — assume the check gate's linter is the source of truth for formatting/style rules and focus review on what tooling can't catch.
